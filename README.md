- [ ] Allow environment variables in yaml config
- [ ] Run pipelines concurrently
- [ ] Add lots more transformation steps from both common open source libraries and popular api's
- [ ] Add a meta type for reusable pipelines
- [ ] Use a scaleable approach to imports and dependencies for steps
- [ ] Option to include user defined steps in a project
- [ ] Deployment functionality
